# LaminarLabeling
LaminarLabeling takes Blackrock .ns6 files and identifies cortical boundaries.
For a detailed description of the methodology please see our manuscript's pre-print:

## Example data
This repository takes an .ns6 file recorded from 32 channel Plexon V-Probes acutely penetrated into Macaque V1. Example data is freely availabley upon request: brock.m.carlson@vanderbilt.edu.

## Instructions
run LaminarLabeling in MATLAB
Figures generated show multi-unit-activity, local-field-potentials, current-source-density, and power-spectral-density measures across laminar depth to evoked visual potentials (flashes)
Estimated depth measures are based on the gamma-beta cross in mean power-spectral-density, as discussed in the manuscript.
